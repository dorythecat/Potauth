# Potauth
Everybody loves potatoes. They are the most fulfilling food you can get, and
they will grow on air. They are rich in a lot of nutrients, and very
energy-dense.

If they're so perfect as foods, why wouldn't they make a good authentication
system, right? That is what this project, originally built for
[Hack Club's Authly](https://authly.hackclub.com), was built to prove.

Authenticate yourself with a selection of potato-based steps, that ensure
your uttermost security at all times, thanks to the best food ever.
